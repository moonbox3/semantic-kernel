# Experiments

The following capabilities are marked experimental in the .NET SDK. Once the APIs for these features are stable, the experimental attribute will be removed. In the meantime, these features are subject to change.

You can use the following diagnostic IDs to ignore warnings or errors for a particular experimental feature. For example, to ignore warnings for the embedding services, add `SKEXP0001` to your list of ignored warnings in your .NET project file as well as the ID for the embedding service you want to use. For example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <NoWarn>SKEXP0001,SKEXP0011</NoWarn>
</PropertyGroup>
```
